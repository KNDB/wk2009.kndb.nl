<b>Regulations FMJD World Championship Match 2009 Schwarzman – Georgiev.</b>
<br /><br />
The match is played in 12 games with the standard FMJD international time schedule of 50
moves in 2 hours followed by 25 moves per hour.
<br /><br />
After these 12 games, if necessary, maximum 2 days of tie breaks are played.
The general rule for the match is that the match is won by the player who first wins 3 games in
the total of the match and the tiebreak games.
<br /><br />
However, if a player wins 3 games in the first 12 games with normal tempo the match continues
until all 12 games with normal tempo are played and then if the result of this 12 games is again
equal the tie break will be played until one player wins a next game.
<br /><br />
If there is no winner after the 12 games with normal tempo the tie break games will be played
until the first player to win 3 games in total (normal games and tie break games)
<br /><br />
The tiebreak is played in the following way:
<br /><br />
1. The first day of the tie break 3 rapid games are played with a time schedule of 20 minutes
plus 10 seconds Fisher system.
<br /><br />
2. Also on the first day 3 blitz games are played with a time schedule of 10 minutes and 5
seconds per move Fisher system.
<br /><br />
3. The second day of the tie break maximum 5 micro matches are played following the
“Georgiev-system”.The time schedule of the micro matches is 20 minutes plus 5 seconds
per move Fisher system for an unlimited number of games.After each game in the micro
match the players continue with the time remaining on the clock after the previous game.
The maximum number of micro matches on this second day depends on the number of
games already won in the match. Because the match has to be finished in this second tie
break day the time schedule will be adapted if only zero or one games have come to a decision
in the 12 games and the first tie break day. In that case the time schedule for the micro
matches will be 15 minutes plus 2 seconds per move Fisher system.The micro matches
continue until one of the player wins for the third time.
